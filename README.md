Data Science Toolbox
====================

The Data Science Toolbox is both (1) a collection of command-line tools that facilitate the obtaining, scrubbing, and exploring of data and (2) a Vagrant environment for installing these command-line tools. 

I am aware that this repository is in dire need of some proper documentation. While I am working on this, you can read the following two blog posts to learn more about the command-line tools and the Vagrant environment, respectively. 

1. [7 command-line tools for data science](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html)
