Command-line tools for data science
===================================

This repository is a collection of command-line tools that facilitate the obtaining, scrubbing, and exploring of data. Most of these tools are discussed in the blog post: [7 command-line tools for data science](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html).

Currently, the `box` directory contains a Vagrant environment for installing these command-line tools. This will soon be moved into a [separate repository](https://github.com/DataScienceToolbox/data-science-toolbox). The blog post [Lean, mean data science machine](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html) contains instructions for installing this virtual environment.
