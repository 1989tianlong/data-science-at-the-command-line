Note for Strata Attendees
=========================

On Wednesday Feb 12 at 12:10pm, we're going to talk about rethinking the Data Science Toolbox at [Strata BoF table 3](http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/33601). 
Come and join us when you:

- Are a teacher, author, or company and you would like to enable your students, readers, or employees to get up and running in minutes.
- Have any ideas regarding virtualiziation, provisioning, configuration, command-line menu's, or installers for Windows or Mac OS X.

Hope to see you there!

Data Science Toolbox
====================

If you're a data scientist, installing all the software you need can be quite involved. The goal of the Data Science Toolbox is to provide a virtual environment that will enable you to start doing data science in a matter of minutes. If you're a teacher, author, or company, making sure that your students, readers, or employees have the same software installed (with the correct versions and dependencies) is not straightforward. We envision that this open source project will enable you to easily create a custom virtual environment. 

At this moment, the Data Science Toolbox is both (1) a collection of command-line tools that facilitate the obtaining, scrubbing, and exploring of data and (2) a Vagrant environment for installing these command-line tools. This will soon be broken up into two separate projects. The blog post "[Lean, mean data science machine](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html)
" contains instructions for installing the virtual environment.
